## Thai Personal Income Tax Rates

**A Ladder-Based Tax System**

Thailand employs a ladder-based tax system for individual income tax, meaning the tax rate increases progressively as income rises. 

| Taxable Income (Baht/Year) | Tax Rate |
|---|---|
| 0 - 150,000 | Exempt |
| 150,001 - 300,000 | 5% |
| 300,001 - 500,000 | 10% |
| 500,001 - 750,000 | 15% |
| 750,001 - 1,000,000 | 20% |
| 1,000,001 - 2,000,000 | 25% |
| 2,000,001 - 4,000,000 | 30% |
| Over 4,000,000 | 35% |

**Example 1:**

If your taxable income is 400,000 Baht, you would calculate your tax as follows:

1. **First 150,000 Baht:** Exempt from tax.
2. **Next 150,000 Baht (150,001 - 300,000):** Taxed at 5%. This amounts to 7,500 Baht.
3. **Remaining 100,000 Baht (300,001 - 400,000):** Taxed at 10%. This amounts to 10,000 Baht.

**Total Tax:** 7,500 + 10,000 = 17,500 Baht.

**Example 2:**

If your taxable income is 1,100,000 Baht, you would calculate your tax as follows:

1. **First 150,000 Baht:** Exempt from tax.
2. **Next 150,000 Baht (150,001 - 300,000):** Taxed at 5%. This amounts to 7,500 Baht.
3. **Next 200,000 Baht (300,001 - 500,000):** Taxed at 10%. This amounts to 20,000 Baht.
4. **Next 250,000 Baht (500,001 - 750,000):** Taxed at 15%. This amounts to 37,500 Baht.
5. **Remaining 150,000 Baht (750,001 - 900,000):** Taxed at 20%. This amounts to 30,000 Baht.

**Total Tax:** 7,500 + 20,000 + 37,500 + 30,000 = 95,000 Baht.

**Note:** An individual is considered a tax resident if they spend 180 days or more in Thailand in a calendar year.

**Example 3:**

Calculate the personal income tax for a person with a monthly salary of 50,000 baht


To calculate the annual income tax, we first need to determine the annual salary:
Annual Salary: 50,000 Baht/month * 12 months = 600,000 Baht   
Now, we'll use the Thai income tax brackets to calculate the tax:

First 150,000 Baht: Exempt from tax.
Next 150,000 Baht (150,001 - 300,000): Taxed at 5%. This amounts to 7,500 Baht.   
Remaining 300,000 Baht (300,001 - 600,000): Taxed at 10%. This amounts to 30,000 Baht.
Total Tax: 7,500 + 30,000 = 37,500 Baht.

Therefore, the annual income tax for a person with a monthly salary of 50,000 Baht is 37,500 Baht.
